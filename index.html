        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm a student and frontend developer. I have a passion for
            programming because it allows me to constantly grow and learn.
            Currently, I mainly focus on frontend development, but I have plans to
            expand my skills to backend development.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion for frontend development inspires me to explore modern technologies and best practices. I'm
            confident in my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always eager to learn new frameworks and
            libraries to create creative and responsive web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also place a strong emphasis on writing clean code. It is important to me that my code is readable and
            maintainable. I strive to follow best practices, use descriptive variable names, divide my code into
            functions for reusability and maintainability, and document my code to facilitate collaboration with other
            developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio. I would love to discuss any potential opportunities
            to collaborate or contribute to exciting projects. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact
            information provided on this website.

                <p>During my time at RTU MIREA, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in
                    09.03.03 Applied Informatics. This program provided me with a solid foundation in computer science
                    and
                    information technology.
                </p>
                <p>For my diploma project, I focused on the development of the user interface for an RPA (Robotic
                    Process Automation) platform. The project involved designing and implementing an intuitive and
                    user-friendly interface that would allow users to interact with the RPA platform effectively.
